1.  Install the package `devtools`

2.  Load `devtools` using `library(devtools)`.

3.  Install `prisca` using

    1.  `install_github("lorenzocapp/prisca")`, or

    2.  `install_github("lorenzocapp/prisca", build_vignettes = TRUE)` if you want some illustrative vignettes (note: using `build_vignettes = TRUE` will make the install take longer).

Numerical Experiments in the Manuscript
----------

The draft includes several numerical experiments. Soon a github link will be made available to fully reproduce the paper. While they are based on the same methodology, they rely on a less user-friendly implementation of the functions included in this package.
